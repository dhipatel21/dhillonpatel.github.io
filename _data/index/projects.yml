- name: RGB-D Semantic Segmentation
  i18n: jalpc
  gh_user: dhipatel21
  repo: RGBD-Semantic-Segmentation
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/semantic_segmentation.jpg
  desc: Trained multiple semantic segmentation models, demonstrating improved accuracy with the NYUv2 dataset after adding a depth channel in Python with the PyTorch library

- name: Concussion Detector
  i18n: cpython
  gh_user: dhipatel21
  repo: Concussion-Detector
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/concussion.jpg
  desc: Researched and developed a wearable IMU-based neck/head sensor for better prediction and diagnosis of concussion/whiplash injuries in athletes, using STM32 microcontrollers, UART, I2C, SPI, and ported drivers in C.

- name: Autonomous Robotics - Pursuer-Evader
  i18n: google
  gh_user: dhipatel21
  repo: Pursuer-Evader
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/full_slam.jpg
  desc: Implemented pursuit-evasion behaviors for two differential-wheeled robots using Python and C++, integrating LCM and OpenCV for real-time audio and visual tracking, and achieving autonomous navigation and target acquisition for dynamic and cluttered environments.


- name: Adaptive Cruise Control
  i18n: google
  gh_user: dhipatel21
  repo: Cruise-Control
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/acc.png
  desc: Developed a Simulink model for a vehicle with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and haptic steering, where wheel position controls steering angles and feedback forces. Implemented differential equations to simulate vehicle dynamics, designed logic for speed and position control switching, and integrated a PID-based automatic steering controller while interfacing with hardware components such as ADC, CAN bus, and digital inputs.

- name: Robot Kinematics and Motion Planning
  i18n: google
  url: "/kinematics-motion/"
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/pend.png
  desc: Developed projects in JavaScript and HTML5, covering robot middleware architectures and publish-subscribe messaging models, graph search path planning (A* algorithm), basic physical simulation (Lagrangian dynamics, numerical integrators), proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, forward kinematics (3D geometric matrix transforms, matrix stack composition of transforms, axis-angle rotation by quaternions), inverse kinematics (gradient descent optimization, geometric Jacobian), and motion planning (simple collision detection, sampling-based motion planning).
